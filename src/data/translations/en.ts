		historyText: `Shubham and I have been friends for a long time, and our values have brought us very close. During a conversation about money, we exchanged ideas: ‚ÄúWhat would you do if you were rich?‚Äù He replied that he would open a school for children in his home village. And I replied that I'd like to help people in need, especially in India, and children in particular. So we concluded by saying ‚Äúwhy not do it together?‚Äù. At first it was just a daydream, but then we got into the swing of things and realized that it was possible. All doors opened along the way... we just went for it!
			So Shubham created Meena Hope Foundation, the local Indian referral association for our projects, and I created Le Colibri Indien, the association that communicates about our actions and manages the funds from France.`,
