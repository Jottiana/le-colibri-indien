		fullText: `It all started with two people sharing a common dream: helping others.
  “Shubham and I have been friends for a while, and our shared values brought us closer. One day, while discussing money, we talked about what we would do if we were rich. He said he would open a school for children in need in his native village. He loves his village so much—and even more so the children! I replied that I would like to help people in need, especially in India, and especially children. So we concluded with: 'Why not do it together?' That’s where it all began. At first, it was just a daydream, but we started to explore the idea and realized it could become real. And every door opened along the way… so we went for it!”
  Despite coming from two fundamentally different cultures and countries, we are completely aligned in how we see the world, how we want to help, and what we want to change.
  Shubham created Meena Hope Foundation, the Indian partner association of our projects, and I created Le Colibri Indien, the association that communicates about our actions and manages funds from France.`,
    legend: "The legend of the hummingbird, the inspiration behind our association",
    legendText: `The Native American legend of the Hummingbird, told by Pierre Rabhi:
  “One day, the legend goes, there was a huge forest fire. All the terrified and stunned animals stood watching helplessly. Only the small hummingbird was busy, flying to get drops of water with its beak and dropping them on the fire. After a while, the armadillo, annoyed by this seemingly useless hustle, said: ‘Hummingbird! Are you crazy? You won't put out the fire with those drops of water!’ And the hummingbird replied: ‘I know, but I’m doing my part.’”
  
  The moral of the legend:
  Rather than doing nothing in the face of current social, environmental or economic issues because we feel powerless or think the solution must come from others, we can act using our skills and on our own scale.
  Even if, taken individually, our actions may seem small, it is thanks to the sum of all hummingbird actions that change happens. I would add this quote from Gandhi:
  “Be the change you want to see in the world.”
  
  Yes, we often hear that hummingbird actions do little to reduce environmental impact. But even if these efforts are insufficient, they are for us absolutely necessary.
  We believe simplicity is the essential path to question our lives and our impact. These small steps of the hummingbird lead us to more autonomy, and then to cooperation. And that’s when we can act together with strength.`,
